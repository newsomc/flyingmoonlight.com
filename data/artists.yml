  bio:
    main: "<strong>George Sand</strong> (feat. Jay Pluck of Ed Askew Band) has been called a '... strange, minimalist keyboard band... Jay Pluck has obviously had some immersion in Philip Glass, there's a hypnotic aspect to this music, but it's more raw and ragged and gently, methodically disquieting. Think of the creepy cinematics of In the Summer House and you'll be on the right track. All of the songs are working subtle, precisely articulated variations on broken chords, with an uneasy, modal melodic sense... (and) feature nebulously ominous guy/girl harmonies.' <i>- New York Music Daily</i>"

    origin: "George Sand began when Jay Pluck and Kelly Keliher started a band with Jeffrey Pratt called Koning's Blauw. K.'s B. moved from idea-driven percussion to evocative songs. After Kelly moved to San Francisco, Candace Thompson applied her interest in Appalachian-style singing. Michael Durek and Julia Violet helped Jay P. with his long-song project after the end of K's B. This became George Sand -- happily, Candace and Jay again started working together in earnest and Jay's bandmate in Ed Askew Band, Tyler Evans, began to make heady contributions."

    description: "The 'Caroline EP' is a paean to a New York City life, it is a modern hymn of devotion to literary humans - Antonia Shimerda, Moses, Gwendolyn Harleth & Daniel Deronda. The three songs are the first G.S. tunes written with the full band in mind and strive to be open-ended with sudden shifts and continuous harmony."

  bio:
    main: "Called 'a crazy diamond from the NYC underground,' Hairy Sands lives up to it with their newest album, Tears (Flying Moonlight). The band features Clint Newsom (bass on VietNam's last album 'An American Dream'), Tim Kuhl (of Sean Lennon's GOASTT), David Nolen and Danica Newell. They've shared the stage with the likes of Prince Rupert's Drops, Sophia Knapp (Drag City), and Jonas Rienhardt (Kranky). Last October the band toured Europe from Paris to Madrid playing secret shows in hidden mountain venues and ocean-side huts. Praised for their 'beautifully quirky' performance at Loophole from the Berlin's leftist paper Taz, Hairy Sands' music has since been popping up on several Euro playlists and top tens."
    detail: "If there is a common thread that runs through the decade long existence of Hairy Sands, it is a childlike willingness to let anything be the beginning for a musical idea. Started as an outlet for recording sounds on the fly, Hairy Sands combine intricate guitar playing with layered harmonies, and polyrythmic bass and piano parts. Hairy Sands is Clint Newsom, David Nolen and Danica Newell."
    origin: "They began in an apartment accross from the park."
