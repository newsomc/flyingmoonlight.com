  name: "Tim Kuhl"
  bio:
    main: "<p>Tim Kuhl is a drummer, composer, percussionist, producer, and band leader.  Born and raised in Baltimore, MD as one of five boys in a musical household, he studied classical and jazz forms before leaving home for New York City.  He has toured and recorded with a diverse range of artists in addition to having been a full time member of many NYC bands like The Izzys, Invisible Familiars, and the experimental group Little Worlds, whose Bela Bartok interpretations have garnered international critical praise.</p>
<p>As a composer he has released a number of self-produced jazz and experimental records culminating in 2012's St. Helena, which featured an all-star cast of New York music luminaries.  He is presently touring and recording as a full member of Sean Lennon's The GOASTT.</p>"
    detail: "Tim Kuhl spent years immersed in Symphonic, Orchestral, Percussion Ensemble, Jazz Big Band and Small Group, Latin Jazz, Commercial, Jazz Guitar, Theater (Pit Percussion), Modern Classical Composer's Concert. He pursued classical percussion studies with Dale Rauschenberg and Michelle Humphreys and drum set with Jon Seligman. This diverse and ardent work has resulted in a masterful approach to the drum kit. His unique style and respect have made Kuhl an integral part of the Brooklyn music landscape and a transformative part of outfits that span many musical genres beyond jazz, including avant-garde, rock, and songwriter. They have also taken him around the U.S. and to many other countries.</p>

<p>Kuhl's extensive technical ability and what is always a creative, dynamic approach to the kit, never prevent him from searching for the heart of the matter. As he says, if the emotion is there, you can do plenty with one note. This attention to detail and supreme ability to listen, to recognize a feeling in one quiet sound, help explain his interests and evolution as a composer. <a href='https://timkuhl1.bandcamp.com/album/ghost'>Ghost</a> (2008) balanced musicians from the Baltimore scene with that of New York. <a href='https://timkuhl1.bandcamp.com/album/king'>King</a> (2009) brought together two voracious guitarists with contrasting styles to great effect. <a href='https://timkuhl1.bandcamp.com/album/doomsayer'>Doomsayer</a> (2011) explored the threat and genius of musical freedom. And his last album, <a href='https://timkuhl1.bandcamp.com/album/st-helena-2'>St. Helena</a> (2012), values deeply something subtle and even cinematic.</p>"

  name: "George Sand"
  bio:
    main: "<strong>George Sand</strong> (feat. Jay Pluck of Ed Askew Band) has been called a '... strange, minimalist keyboard band... Jay Pluck has obviously had some immersion in Philip Glass, there's a hypnotic aspect to this music, but it's more raw and ragged and gently, methodically disquieting. Think of the creepy cinematics of In the Summer House and you'll be on the right track. All of the songs are working subtle, precisely articulated variations on broken chords, with an uneasy, modal melodic sense... (and) feature nebulously ominous guy/girl harmonies.' <i>- New York Music Daily</i>"

    origin: "George Sand began when Jay Pluck and Kelly Keliher started a band with Jeffrey Pratt called Koning's Blauw. K.'s B. moved from idea-driven percussion to evocative songs. After Kelly moved to San Francisco, Candace Thompson applied her interest in Appalachian-style singing. Michael Durek and Julia Violet helped Jay P. with his long-song project after the end of K's B. This became George Sand -- happily, Candace and Jay again started working together in earnest and Jay's bandmate in Ed Askew Band, Tyler Evans, began to make heady contributions."

  bio:
    main: "<p>Called \"a crazy diamond from the NYC underground\", Hairy Sands lives up to it with their newest album, <a href='hairysands.bandcamp.com/album/tears'>Tears</a>. The band features Clint Newsom (bass on VietNam's last album <a href='http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-american-dream-mw0002473205'>\"An American Dream\"</a>), Tim Kuhl (of Sean Lennon's <a href='http://www.thegoastt.com'>GOASTT</a>), David Nolen and Danica Newell.

    detail: "<p>If there is a common thread that runs through the decade long existence of Hairy Sands, it is a childlike willingness to let anything be the beginning for a musical idea. Started as an outlet for recording sounds on the fly, Hairy Sands combine intricate guitar playing with layered harmonies, and polyrythmic bass and piano parts. Hairy Sands is Clint Newsom, David Nolen and Danica Newell.</p> <p>Hairy Sands is currently writing a new record to be recorded later in 2015 and is playing shows in and around Brooklyn, D.C. and Philadelphia.</p>"
    origin: "<p>Hairy Sands began as a recording project in a small apartment room accross from Cooper Park in Williasmburg, Brooklyn. Clint Newsom and David Nolen would gather any number of friends together late into the night to dream-up, write, and record songs on the fly. Songs from their first release <a href=''>'Sandy Hairs'</a> were written and recorded with Yamal Said (Knife in the Water), Zach Hennard and Danica Newell in home and professional studios in Texas, Louisiana and Brooklyn. The band began to play more regularly when all three members moved to Brooklyn permanently. Initally, with Markus Gorsch of the Swedish band <i>Love is All</i> on drums and more recently with the artist Tim Kuhl. </p>"

It incorporates multiple lead voices, layerd guitars, vocal harmonies, polyrhythmic bass and piano, vintage synthesizers. Each song balances complexity with repetition, and lyrics tend toward the impressionistic, describing scenes of nature, moments of spiritual connection, and vivid physical environments."
