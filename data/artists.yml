  bio:
    main: "After 15 years of creating soundtracks to aid space travelers, Dallas Acid returns this Summer with a new double LP, Original Soundtrack, cataloguing their recent explorations of distant stars. The seminal cosmic synth-scape outfit pilots you on a deep space journey, diving into washes of shifting sound waves and through the burning growls and screaming white noise of uncharted anomalies. Rhythms of primordial ritual carry you past warped melodies which break apart in the gravitational pull, and trickling oscillator fluctuations burn like cinders in the cold emptiness. Experience purification through fire, a cleansing of the soul in the deep warmth of the sun."

    description: "<p> Recorded in 2013, the digital self-release of <strong>Beyond the Orchard</strong> was an important album in the burgeoning acid-folk Chicago sound. This cassette release is the first physical release of these recordings, which sound particularly majestic when played on tape.</p> 

<p>It is the most song-based work of artist, Muyassar Kurdi. The songs are rumbling and solid. The vocal, Autoharp, organ, and percussion layers are live and immediate; even the reverb has a sharpness. This urgency predicts Kurdi's next album, White Noise, and also her current work in improvisation and song.</p>

<p> \"(A) twenty-four minute batch of unsettling siren songs, gauze-draped ballads, and rumbling off-kilter loops... The first three pieces are a solid introduction - in brief snippets - to Kurdi's art, culminating in the aptly-titled \"Drone\", which takes a page from the Journey in Satchidananda book and melds tanpura, oscillators and feedback into a short but arresting instrumental piece. The following three tunes are a bit longer, hovering around four to six minutes, and range from the nearly oppressive wash of \"Dear Momma\" to the folksy echoed beauty of \"Don't Want Your Love.\" The closing title composition brings the fuzz in a wander of queasy repetition, percussion and blown-out organ that looks somewhat toward early CDY/Espers.\"<p> -- <strong>Clifford Allen for Tiny Mix Tapes</strong>"

tim-kuhl:
  name: "Tim Kuhl"
  bio:
    main: "<p>Tim Kuhl is a drummer, composer, percussionist, producer, and band leader.  Born and raised in Baltimore, MD as one of five boys in a musical household, he studied classical and jazz forms before leaving home for New York City.  He has toured and recorded with a diverse range of artists in addition to having been a full time member of many NYC bands like The Izzys, Invisible Familiars, and the experimental group Little Worlds, whose Bela Bartok interpretations have garnered international critical praise.</p>
<p>As a composer he has released a number of self-produced jazz and experimental records culminating in 2012's St. Helena, which featured an all-star cast of New York music luminaries.  He is presently touring and recording as a full member of Sean Lennon's The GOASTT.</p>"
    detail: "Tim Kuhl spent years immersed in Symphonic, Orchestral, Percussion Ensemble, Jazz Big Band and Small Group, Latin Jazz, Commercial, Jazz Guitar, Theater (Pit Percussion), Modern Classical Composer's Concert. He pursued classical percussion studies with Dale Rauschenberg and Michelle Humphreys and drum set with Jon Seligman. This diverse and ardent work has resulted in a masterful approach to the drum kit. His unique style and respect have made Kuhl an integral part of the Brooklyn music landscape and a transformative part of outfits that span many musical genres beyond jazz, including avant-garde, rock, and songwriter. They have also taken him around the U.S. and to many other countries.</p>

<p>Kuhl's extensive technical ability and what is always a creative, dynamic approach to the kit, never prevent him from searching for the heart of the matter. As he says, if the emotion is there, you can do plenty with one note. This attention to detail and supreme ability to listen, to recognize a feeling in one quiet sound, help explain his interests and evolution as a composer. <a href='https://timkuhl.bandcamp.com/album/ghost'>Ghost</a> (2008) balanced musicians from the Baltimore scene with that of New York. <a href='https://timkuhl.bandcamp.com/album/king'>King</a> (2009) brought together two voracious guitarists with contrasting styles to great effect. <a href='https://timkuhl.bandcamp.com/album/doomsayer'>Doomsayer</a> (2011) explored the threat and genius of musical freedom. And his last album, <a href='https://timkuhl.bandcamp.com/album/st-helena-2'>St. Helena</a> (2012), values deeply something subtle and even cinematic.</p>

While on a break from traveling, Kuhl brought the songs to co-producer and NYC engineer <strong>Joshua Valleau (WOLVVES, John Legend, etc)</strong>, together they fleshed out the textures and sounds around the compositions.

  bio:
    main: "<p>Kyle Forester cut his psych-pop teeth as keyboardist in Crystal Stilts and The Ladybug Transistor, and his first solo LP scatters nods to those days throughout a 12-song statement of purpose that aims for the moment when resignation meets clear-eyed hope. The record's awash in late-afternoon reflectiveness reminiscent of Beck's \"Sea Change\", with echoes of Brian Eno's \"Another Green World\" clattering up and down the spines of the songs. A 70's troubadour vibe pulls the coasts together, exploring unreal streets where the wolf kings of LA find themselves prowling downtown NYC.</p><p>At first listen you might think you remember these melodies from somewhere, but that's just because their warmth is drawing you closer to realizing you've been pining for what you already have, and now that the right kind of light is shining down, you can finally see it.</p>"

# George Sand
#     main: "<i>'... strange, minimalist keyboard band... Jay Pluck has obviously had some immersion in Philip Glass, there's a hypnotic aspect to this music, but it's more raw and ragged and gently, methodically disquieting. Think of the creepy cinematics of In the Summer House and you'll be on the right track. All of the songs are working subtle, precisely articulated variations on broken chords, with an uneasy, modal melodic sense... (and) feature nebulously ominous guy/girl harmonies.' </i>- <strong>New York Music Daily</strong>"
#     detail: "<p>George Sand is a piano-based art pop band from principle songwriter Jay Pluck (Ed Askew Band, Luke Roberts, IOLA). With Candace Thompson, Kelly Keliher (Nativenaive, Heidi Harris), and Tyler Evans (The Black Swans, Ed Askew Band, Malefactor), G.S. plays regularly in New York City. They are often joined by Michael Durek (PAS, The Use) and Clint Newsom (Hairy Sands, Vietnam).</p>
# <p>Piano, voice, Autoharp, guitar, theremin, and bass comprise most G.S. tunes, which they call modern hymns.</p>
# <p>George Sand toured Europe in support of Caroline EP with labelmates, Hairy Sands. They have been active in NYC for over three years, playing shows with the legendary The Scene is Now, Daniel Carter, Weyes Blood, Reg Bloor, Rachel Trachtenburg, Christy & Emily, Opal Onyx, Bob Bannister and Eartheater, among others.</p>"

#     origin: "George Sand began when Jay Pluck and Kelly Keliher started a band with Jeffrey Pratt called Koning's Blauw. K.'s B. moved from idea-driven percussion to evocative songs. After Kelly moved to San Francisco, Candace Thompson applied her interest in Appalachian-style singing. Michael Durek and Julia Violet helped Jay P. with his long-song project after the end of K's B. This became George Sand -- happily, Candace and Jay again started working together in earnest and Jay's bandmate in Ed Askew Band, Tyler Evans, began to make heady contributions."

#     played_with: "<p>George Sand has played consistently in NYC for over two years, touring the east coast and also going to Berlin three times. G.S. also toured France, Spain, and Germany with labelmates, Hairy Sands.</p>
