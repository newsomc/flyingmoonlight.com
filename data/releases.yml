    description: "The 'Caroline EP' is a paean to a New York City life, it is a modern hymn of devotion to literary humans - Antonia Shimerda, Moses, Gwendolyn Harleth & Daniel Deronda. The three songs are the first G.S. tunes written with the full band in mind and strive to be open-ended with sudden shifts and continuous harmony."
