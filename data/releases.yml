    description: "<p> Recorded in 2013, the digital self-release of <strong>Beyond the Orchard</strong> was an important album in the burgeoning acid-folk Chicago sound. This cassette release is the first physical release of these recordings, which sound particularly majestic when played on tape.</p> 

<p>It is the most song-based work of artist, Muyassar Kurdi. The songs are rumbling and solid. The vocal, Autoharp, organ, and percussion layers are live and immediate; even the reverb has a sharpness. This urgency predicts Kurdi's next album, White Noise, and also her current work in improvisation and song.</p>

<p> \"(A) twenty-four minute batch of unsettling siren songs, gauze-draped ballads, and rumbling off-kilter loops... The first three pieces are a solid introduction - in brief snippets - to Kurdi's art, culminating in the aptly-titled \"Drone\", which takes a page from the Journey in Satchidananda book and melds tanpura, oscillators and feedback into a short but arresting instrumental piece. The following three tunes are a bit longer, hovering around four to six minutes, and range from the nearly oppressive wash of \"Dear Momma\" to the folksy echoed beauty of \"Don't Want Your Love.\" The closing title composition brings the fuzz in a wander of queasy repetition, percussion and blown-out organ that looks somewhat toward early CDY/Espers.\"<p> -- <strong>Clifford Allen for Tiny Mix Tapes</strong>"
